# Storing data on classic IBM Cloud File Storage
{: #file_storage}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} File Storage is persistent, fast, and flexible network-attached, NFS-based file storage that you can add to your apps by using Kubernetes persistent volumes (PVs). You can choose between predefined storage tiers with GB sizes and IOPS that meet the requirements of your workloads. To find out if {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} File Storage is the right storage option for you, see [Choosing a storage solution](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#choose_storage_solution). For pricing information, see [Billing](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-about#billing).
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} File Storage is available for standard clusters only that are set up with public network connectivity. If your cluster cannot access the public network, such as a private cluster behind a firewall or a cluster with only the private service endpoint enabled, you can provision file storage if your cluster runs Kubernetes version 1.13.4_1513, 1.12.6_1544, 1.11.8_1550, or later. NFS file storage instances are specific to a single zone. If you have a multizone cluster, consider [multizone persistent storage options](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#persistent_storage_overview).
{: important}

## Deciding on the file storage configuration
{: #file_predefined_storageclass}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} provides pre-defined storage classes for file storage that you can use to provision file storage with a specific configuration.
{: shortdesc}

Every storage class specifies the type of file storage that you provision, including available size, IOPS, file system, and the retention policy.  

After you provision a specific type of storage by using a storage class, you cannot change the type, or retention policy for the storage device. However, you can [change the size and the IOPS](#file_change_storage_configuration) if you want to increase your storage capacity and performance. To change the type and retention policy for your storage, you must [create a new storage instance and copy the data](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#update_storageclass) from the old storage instance to your new one.
{: important}

Before you begin: [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

To decide on a storage configuration:

1. List available storage classes in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
   ```
   kubectl get storageclasses | grep file
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   $ kubectl get storageclasses
   NAME                         TYPE
   ibmc-file-bronze (default)   ibm.io/ibmc-file
   ibmc-file-custom             ibm.io/ibmc-file
   ibmc-file-gold               ibm.io/ibmc-file
   ibmc-file-retain-bronze      ibm.io/ibmc-file
   ibmc-file-retain-custom      ibm.io/ibmc-file
   ibmc-file-retain-gold        ibm.io/ibmc-file
   ibmc-file-retain-silver      ibm.io/ibmc-file
   ibmc-file-silver             ibm.io/ibmc-file
   ```
   {: screen}

2. Review the configuration of a storage class.
  ```
  kubectl describe storageclass <storageclass_name>
  ```
  {: pre}

   For more information about each storage class, see the [storage class reference](#file_storageclass_reference). If you do not find what you are looking for, consider creating your own customized storage class. To get started, check out the [customized storage class samples](#file_custom_storageclass).
   {: tip}

3. Choose the type of file storage that you want to provision.
   - **Bronze, silver, and gold storage classes:** These storage classes provision [Endurance storage](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-about#provisioning-with-endurance-tiers). Endurance storage lets you choose the size of the storage in gigabytes at predefined IOPS tiers.
   - **Custom storage class:** This storage class provisions [Performance storage](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-about#provisioning-with-performance). With performance storage, you have more control over the size of the storage and the IOPS.

4. Choose the size and IOPS for your file storage. The size and the number of IOPS define the total number of IOPS (input/ output operations per second) that serves as an indicator for how fast your storage is. The more total IOPS your storage has, the faster it processes read and write operations.
   - **Bronze, silver, and gold storage classes:** These storage classes come with a fixed number of IOPS per gigabyte and are provisioned on SSD hard disks. The total number of IOPS depends on the size of the storage that you choose. You can select any whole number of gigabyte within the allowed size range, such as 20 Gi, 256 Gi, or 11854 Gi. To determine the total number of IOPS, you must multiply the IOPS with the selected size. For example, if you select a 1000Gi file storage size in the silver storage class that comes with 4 IOPS per GB, your storage has a total of 4000 IOPS.

         </tbody></table>
   - **Custom storage class:** When you choose this storage class, you have more control over the size and IOPS that you want. For the size, you can select any whole number of gigabyte within the allowed size range. The size that you choose determines the IOPS range that is available to you. You can choose an IOPS that is a multiple of 100 that is in the specified range. The IOPS that you choose is static and does not scale with the size of the storage. For example, if you choose 40Gi with 100 IOPS, your total IOPS remains 100. </br></br> The IOPS to gigabyte ratio also determines the type of hard disk that is provisioned for you. For example, if you have 500Gi at 100 IOPS, your IOPS to gigabyte ratio is 0.2. Storage with a ratio of less than or equal to 0.3 is provisioned on SATA hard disks. If your ratio is greater than 0.3, then your storage is provisioned on SSD hard disks.

5. Choose if you want to keep your data after the cluster or the persistent volume claim (PVC) is deleted.
   - If you want to keep your data, then choose a `retain` storage class. When you delete the PVC, only the PVC is deleted. The PV, the physical storage device in your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account, and your data still exist. To reclaim the storage and use it in your cluster again, you must remove the PV and follow the steps for [using existing file storage](#existing_file).
   - If you want the PV, the data, and your physical file storage device to be deleted when you delete the PVC, choose a storage class without `retain`.

6. Choose if you want to be billed hourly or monthly. Check the [pricing ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/file-storage/pricing) for more information. By default, all file storage devices are provisioned with an hourly billing type.
   If you choose a monthly billing type, when you remove the persistent storage, you still pay the monthly charge for it, even if you used it only for a short amount of time.
   {: note}

<br />



## Adding file storage to apps
{: #add_file}

Create a persistent volume claim (PVC) to [dynamically provision](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#dynamic_provisioning) file storage for your cluster. Dynamic provisioning automatically creates the matching persistent volume (PV) and orders the physical storage device in your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:
- If you have a firewall, [allow egress access](/docs/containers?topic=containers-firewall#pvc) for the IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) IP ranges of the zones that your clusters are in so that you can create PVCs.
- [Decide on a pre-defined storage class](#file_predefined_storageclass) or create a [customized storage class](#file_custom_storageclass).

Looking to deploy file storage in a stateful set? See [Using file storage in a stateful set](#file_statefulset) for more information.
{: tip}

To add file storage:

1.  Create a configuration file to define your persistent volume claim (PVC) and save the configuration as a `.yaml` file.

    - **Example for bronze, silver, gold storage classes**:
       The following `.yaml` file creates a claim that is named `mypvc` of the `"ibmc-file-silver"` storage class, billed `"monthly"`, with a gigabyte size of `24Gi`.

       ```
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
       metadata:
         name: mypvc
         labels:
           billingType: "monthly"
           region: us-south
           zone: dal13
       spec:
         accessModes:
           - ReadWriteMany
         resources:
           requests:
             storage: 24Gi
         storageClassName: ibmc-file-silver
       ```
       {: codeblock}

    -  **Example for using the custom storage class**:
       The following `.yaml` file creates a claim that is named `mypvc` of the storage class `ibmc-file-retain-custom`, billed `"hourly"`, with a gigabyte size of `45Gi` and IOPS of `"300"`.

       ```
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
       metadata:
         name: mypvc
         labels:
           billingType: "hourly"
           region: us-south
           zone: dal13
       spec:
         accessModes:
           - ReadWriteMany
         resources:
           requests:
             storage: 45Gi
             iops: "300"
         storageClassName: ibmc-file-retain-custom

## Using existing file storage in your cluster
{: #existing_file}

If you have an existing physical storage device that you want to use in your cluster, you can manually create the PV and PVC to [statically provision](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#static_provisioning) the storage.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin:
- Make sure that you have at least one worker node that exists in the same zone as your existing file storage instance.
- [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

### Step 1: Preparing your existing storage.
{: #existing-file-1}

Before you can start to mount your existing storage to an app, you must retrieve all necessary information for your PV and prepare the storage to be accessible in your cluster.

**For storage that was provisioned with a `retain` storage class:** </br>
If you provisioned storage with a `retain` storage class and you remove the PVC, the PV and the physical storage device are not automatically removed. To reuse the storage in your cluster, you must remove the remaining PV first.

To use existing storage in a different cluster than the one where you provisioned it, follow the steps for [storage that was created outside of the cluster](#external_storage) to add the storage to the subnet of your worker node.
{: tip}

1. List existing PVs.
   ```
   kubectl get pv
   ```
   {: pre}

   Look for the PV that belongs to your persistent storage. The PV is in a `released` state.

2. Get the details of the PV.
   ```
   kubectl describe pv <pv_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Note the `CapacityGb`, `storageClass`, `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region`, `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone`, `server`, and `path`.

4. Remove the PV.
   ```
   kubectl delete pv <pv_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Verify that the PV is removed.
   ```
   kubectl get pv
   ```
   {: pre}

</br>

**For persistent storage that was provisioned outside the cluster:** </br>
If you want to use existing storage that you provisioned earlier, but never used in your cluster before, you must make the storage available in the same subnet as your worker nodes.

1.  {: #external_storage}From the [IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/classic?), click **Storage**.
2.  Click **File Storage** and from the **Actions** menu, select **Authorize Host**.
3.  Select **Subnets**.
4.  From the drop-down list, select the private VLAN subnet that your worker node is connected to. To find the subnet of your worker node, run `ibmcloud ks workers --cluster <cluster_name>` and compare the `Private IP` of your worker node with the subnet that you found in the drop-down list.
5.  Click **Submit**.
6.  Click the name of the file storage.
7.  Note the `Mount Point`, the `size`, and the `Location` field. The `Mount Point` field is displayed as `<nfs_server>:<file_storage_path>`.

### Step 2: Creating a persistent volume (PV) and a matching persistent volume claim (PVC)
{: #existing-file-2}

1.  Create a storage configuration file for your PV. Include the values that you retrieved earlier.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
     name: mypv
     labels:
        failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region: <region>
        failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone: <zone>
    spec:
     capacity:
       storage: "<size>"
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteMany
     nfs:
       server: "<nfs_server>"
       path: "<file_storage_path>"
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>spec.capacity.storage</code></td>
    <td>Enter the storage size of the existing NFS file share that you retrieved earlier. The storage size must be written in gigabytes, for example, 20Gi (20 GB) or 1000Gi (1 TB), and the size must match the size of the existing file share.</td>

    <tr>
    <td><code>spec.accessMode</code></td>
    <td>Specify one of the following options: <ul><li><strong>ReadWriteMany: </strong>The PVC can be mounted by multiple pods. All pods can read from and write to the volume. </li><li><strong>ReadOnlyMany: </strong>The PVC can be mounted by multiple pods. All pods have read-only access. <li><strong>ReadWriteOnce: </strong>The PVC can be mounted by one pod only. This pod can read from and write to the volume. </li></ul></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>path</code></td>
    <td>Enter the path to the NFS file share that you retrieved earlier.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody></table>

3.  Create the PV in your cluster.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f mypv.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

4.  Verify that the PV is created.

    ```
    kubectl get pv
    ```
    {: pre}

5.  Create another configuration file to create your PVC. In order for the PVC to match the PV that you created earlier, you must choose the same value for `storage` and `accessMode`. The `storage-class` field must be empty. If any of these fields do not match the PV, then a new PV, and a new physical storage instance is [dynamically provisioned](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#dynamic_provisioning).

    ```
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
     name: mypvc
    spec:
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteMany
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: "<size>"
     storageClassName:
    ```
    {: codeblock}

6.  Create your PVC.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f mypvc.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

7.  Verify that your PVC is created and bound to the PV. This process can take a few minutes.

    ```
    kubectl describe pvc mypvc
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```

## Using file storage in a stateful set
{: #file_statefulset}

If you have a stateful app such as a database, you can create stateful sets that use file storage to store your app's data. Alternatively, you can use an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} database-as-a-service and store your data in the cloud.
{: shortdesc}

**What do I need to be aware of when adding file storage to a stateful set?** </br>
To add storage to a stateful set, you specify your storage configuration in the `volumeClaimTemplates` section of your stateful set YAML. The `volumeClaimTemplates` is the basis for your PVC and can include the storage class and the size or IOPS of your file storage that you want to provision. However, if you want to include labels in your `volumeClaimTemplates`, Kubernetes does not include these labels when creating the PVC. Instead, you must add the labels directly to your stateful set.

You cannot deploy two stateful sets at the same time. If you try to create a stateful set before a different one is fully deployed, then the deployment of your stateful set might lead to unexpected results.
{: important}

**How can I create my stateful set in a specific zone?** </br>
In a multizone cluster, you can specify the zone and region where you want to create your stateful set in the `spec.selector.matchLabels` and `spec.template.metadata.labels` section of your stateful set YAML. Alternatively, you can add those labels to a [customized storage class](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#customized_storageclass) and use this storage class in the `volumeClaimTemplates` section of your stateful set.

**Can I delay binding of a PV to my stateful pod until the pod is ready?**<br>
Yes, you can [create a custom storage class](#file-topology) for your PVC that includes the [`volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer` ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#volume-binding-mode) field.

**What options do I have to add file storage to a stateful set?** </br>
If you want to automatically create your PVC when you create the stateful set, use [dynamic provisioning](#file_dynamic_statefulset). You can also choose to [pre-provision your PVCs or use existing PVCs](#file_static_statefulset) with your stateful set.  

### Dynamic provisioning: Creating the PVC when you create a stateful set
{: #file_dynamic_statefulset}

Use this option if you want to automatically create the PVC when you create the stateful set.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin: [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

1. Verify that all existing stateful sets in your cluster are fully deployed. If a stateful set is still being deployed, you cannot start creating your stateful set. You must wait until all stateful sets in your cluster are fully deployed to avoid unexpected results.
   1. List existing stateful sets in your cluster.
      ```
      kubectl get statefulset --all-namespaces
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```
      NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE
      mystatefulset     3         3         6s
      ```
      {: screen}

   2. View the **Pods Status** of each stateful set to ensure that the deployment of the stateful set is finished.  
      ```
      kubectl describe statefulset <statefulset_name>
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```

      ...
      ```
      {: screen}

      A stateful set is fully deployed when the number of replicas that you find in the **Replicas** section of your CLI output equals the number of **Running** pods in the **Pods Status** section. If a stateful set is not fully deployed yet, wait until the deployment is finished before you proceed.

2. Create a configuration file for your stateful set and the service that you use to expose the stateful set.

  - **Example stateful set that specifies a zone:**

    The following example shows how to deploy NGINX as a stateful set with 3 replicas. For each replica, a 20 gigabyte file storage device is provisioned based on the specifications in the `ibmc-file-retain-bronze` storage class. All storage devices are provisioned in the `dal10` zone. Because file storage cannot be accessed from other zones, all replicas of the stateful set are also deployed onto worker nodes that are located in `dal10`.

    ```

         storageClassName: ibmc-file-retain-bronze
    ```
    {: codeblock}

  - **Example stateful set with anti-affinity rule and delayed file storage creation:**

    The following example shows how to deploy NGINX as a stateful set with 3 replicas. The stateful set does not specify the region and zone where the file storage is created. Instead, the stateful set uses an anti-affinity rule to ensure that the pods are spread across worker nodes and zones. Worker node anti-affinity is achieved by defining the `app: nginx` label. This label instructs the Kubernetes scheduler to not schedule a pod on a worker node if a pod with the same label already runs on this worker node. The `topologykey: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone` label restricts this anti-affinity rule even more and prevents the pod to be scheduled on a worker node that is located in the same zone as a worker node that already runs a pod with the `app: nginx` label. For each stateful set pod, two PVCs are created as defined in the `volumeClaimTemplates` section, but the creation of the file storage instances is delayed until a stateful set pod that uses the storage is scheduled. This setup is referred to as [topology-aware volume scheduling](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/10/11/topology-aware-volume-provisioning-in-kubernetes/).

   To see the current status of your PVCs, run `kubectl get pvc`. The name of your PVC is formatted as `<volume_name>-<statefulset_name>-<replica_number>`.
   {: tip}

### Static provisioning: Using an existing PVC with your stateful set
{: #file_static_statefulset}

You can pre-provision your PVCs before creating your stateful set or use existing PVCs with your stateful set.
{: shortdesc}

When you [dynamically provision your PVCs when creating the stateful set](#file_dynamic_statefulset), the name of the PVC is assigned based on the values that you used in the stateful set YAML file. In order for the stateful set to use existing PVCs, the name of your PVCs must match the name that would automatically be created when using dynamic provisioning.

Before you begin: [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

1. If you want to pre-provision your PVC before you create the stateful set, follow steps 1-3 in [Adding file storage to apps](#add_file) to create a PVC for each stateful set replica. Make sure that you create your PVC with a name that follows the following format: `<volume_name>-<statefulset_name>-<replica_number>`.
   - **`<volume_name>`**: Use the name that you want to specify in the `spec.volumeClaimTemplates.metadata.name` section of your stateful set, such as `nginxvol`.
   - **`<statefulset_name>`**: Use the name that you want to specify in the `metadata.name` section of your stateful set, such as `nginx_statefulset`.
   - **`<replica_number>`**: Enter the number of your replica starting with 0.

   For example, if you must create 3 stateful set replicas, create 3 PVCs with the following names: `nginxvol-nginx_statefulset-0`, `nginxvol-nginx_statefulset-1`, and `nginxvol-nginx_statefulset-2`.  

   Looking to create a PVC and PV for an existing file storage instance? Create your PVC and PV by using [static provisioning](#existing_file).
   {: tip}

2. Follow the steps in [Dynamic provisioning: Creating the PVC when you create a stateful set](#file_dynamic_statefulset) to create your stateful set. The name of your PVC follows the format `<volume_name>-<statefulset_name>-<replica_number>`. Make sure to use the following values from your PVC name in the stateful set specification:
   - **`spec.volumeClaimTemplates.metadata.name`**: Enter the `<volume_name>` of your PVC name.
   - **`metadata.name`**: Enter the `<statefulset_name>` of your PVC name.
   - **`spec.replicas`**: Enter the number of replicas that you want to create for your stateful set. The number of replicas must equal the number of PVCs that you created earlier.

   If your PVCs are in different zones, do not include a region or zone label in your stateful set.
   {: note}

3. Verify that the PVCs are used in your stateful set replica pods.
   1. List the pods in your cluster. Identify the pods that belong to your stateful set.
      ```
      kubectl get pods
      ```
      {: pre}

   2. Verify that your existing PVC is mounted to your stateful set replica. Review the **`ClaimName`** in the **`Volumes`** section of your CLI output.
      ```
      kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```
      Name:           nginx-0
      Namespace:      default
      Node:           10.xxx.xx.xxx/10.xxx.xx.xxx

## Changing the size and IOPS of your existing storage device
{: #file_change_storage_configuration}

If you want to increase storage capacity or performance, you can modify your existing volume.
{: shortdesc}

For questions about billing and to find the steps for how to use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console to modify your storage, see [Expanding File Share capacity](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-expandCapacity#expandCapacity).
{: tip}

1. List the PVCs in your cluster and note the name of the associated PV from the **VOLUME** column.
   ```
   kubectl get pvc
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   NAME             STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS        AGE

   ```
   {: screen}

2. Retrieve the **`StorageType`**, **`volumeId`**, and the **`server`** of the physical file storage that is associated with your PVC by listing the details of the PV that your PVC is bound to. Replace `<pv_name>` with the name of the PV that you retrieved in the previous step. The storage type, volume ID, and the server name are shown in the **`Labels`** section of your CLI output.
   ```
   kubectl describe pv <pv_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   Name:            pvc-4b62c704-5f77-11e8-8a75-b229c11ba64a

   ...
   ```
   {: screen}

3. Modify the size or IOPS of your volume in your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account.

   Example for performance storage:
   ```
   ibmcloud sl file volume-modify <volume_ID> --new-size <size> --new-iops <iops>
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example for endurance storage:

   {: screen}

4. If you changed the size of your volume and you use the volume in a pod, log in to your pod to verify the new size.
   1. List all the pods that use PVC.
      ```
      kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.volumes[*]}{.persistentVolumeClaim.claimName}{" "}{end}{end}' | grep "<pvc_name>"

## Changing the default NFS version
{: #nfs_version}

The version of the file storage determines the protocol that is used to communicate with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} file storage server. By default, all file storage instances are set up with NFS version 4. You can change your existing PV to an older NFS version if your app requires a specific version to properly function.
{: shortdesc}

To change the default NFS version, you can either create a new storage class to dynamically provision file storage in your cluster, or choose to change an existing PV that is mounted to your pod.

To apply the latest security updates and for a better performance, use the default NFS version and do not change to an older NFS version.
{: important}

**To create a customized storage class with a specific NFS version:**
1. Create a [customized storage class](#nfs_version_class) with the NFS version that you want to provision.
2. Create the storage class in your cluster.
   ```
   kubectl apply -f nfsversion_storageclass.yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Verify that the customized storage class was created.
   ```
   kubectl get storageclasses
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Provision [file storage](#add_file) with your customized storage class.

**To change your existing PV to use a different NFS version:**

1. Get the PV of the file storage where you want to change the NFS version and note the name of the PV.
   ```
   kubectl get pv
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Add an annotation to your PV. Replace `<version_number>` with the NFS version that you want to use. For example, to change to NFS version 3.0, enter **3**.  
   ```
   kubectl patch pv <pv_name> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"volume.beta.kubernetes.io/mount-options":"vers=<version_number>"}}}'
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Delete the pod that uses the file storage and re-create the pod.
   1. Save the pod YAML to your local machine.
      ```
      kubect get pod <pod_name> -o yaml > <filepath/pod.yaml>
      ```
      {: pre}

   2. Delete the pod.
      ```
      kubectl deleted pod <pod_name>
      ```
      {: pre}

   3. Re-create the pod.
      ```
      kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
      ```
      {: pre}

4. Wait for the pod to deploy.
   ```
   kubectl get pods
   ```
   {: pre}

   The pod is fully deployed when the status changes to `Running`.

5. Log in to your pod.
   ```
   kubectl exec -it <pod_name> sh
   ```
   {: pre}

6. Verify that the file storage was mounted with the NFS version that you specified earlier.
   ```
   mount | grep "nfs" | awk -F" |," '{ print $5, $8 }'
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   nfs vers=3.0
   ```

## Backing up and restoring data
{: #file_backup_restore}

File storage is provisioned into the same location as the worker nodes in your cluster. The storage is hosted on clustered servers by IBM to provide availability in case a server goes down. However, file storage is not backed up automatically and might be inaccessible if the entire location fails. To protect your data from being lost or damaged, you can set up periodic backups that you can use to restore your data when needed.
{: shortdesc}

Review the following backup and restore options for your file storage:

<dl>
  <dt>Set up periodic snapshots</dt>
  <dd><p>You can [set up periodic snapshots for your file storage](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-snapshots), which is a read-only image that captures the state of the instance at a point in time. To store the snapshot, you must request snapshot space on your file storage. Snapshots are stored on the existing storage instance within the same zone. You can restore data from a snapshot if a user accidentally removes important data from the volume.</br> <strong>To create a snapshot for your volume: </strong><ol><li>[Log in to your account.

  <dt>Replicate snapshots to another zone</dt>
 <dd><p>To protect your data from a zone failure, you can [replicate snapshots](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-replication#replication) to a file storage instance that is set up in another zone. Data can be replicated from the primary storage to the backup storage only. You cannot mount a replicated file storage instance to a cluster. When your primary storage fails, you can manually set your replicated backup storage to be the primary one. Then, you can mount it to your cluster. After your primary storage is restored, you can restore the data from the backup storage.</p></dd>
 <dt>Duplicate storage</dt>
 <dd><p>You can [duplicate your file storage instance](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-duplicatevolume#duplicatevolume) in the same zone as the original storage instance. A duplicate has the same data as the original storage instance at the point in time that you create the duplicate. Unlike replicas, use the duplicate as an independent storage instance from the original. To duplicate, first [set up snapshots for the volume](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-snapshots).</p></dd>
  <dt>Back up data to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}}</dt>
  <dd><p>You can use the [**ibm-backup-restore image**](/docs/services/RegistryImages/ibm-backup-restore?topic=RegistryImages-ibmbackup_restore_starter#ibmbackup_restore_starter) to spin up a backup and restore pod in your cluster. This pod contains a script to run a one-time or periodic backup for any persistent volume claim (PVC) in your cluster. Data is stored in your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} instance that you set up in a zone.</p>
  <p>To make your data even more highly available and protect your app from a zone failure, set up a second {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} instance and replicate data across zones. If you need to restore data from your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} instance, use the restore script that is provided with the image.</p></dd>
<dt>Copy data to and from pods and containers</dt>
<dd><p>You can use the `kubectl cp` [command![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/#cp) to copy files and directories to and from pods or specific containers in your cluster.</p>
<p>Before you begin: [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure) If you do not specify a container with <code>-c</code>, the command uses the first available container in the pod.</p>
<p>You can use the command in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy data from your local machine to a pod in your cluster: <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl cp <var>&lt;local_filepath&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</var> <var>&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;pod&gt;:&lt;pod_filepath&gt;</var></code></pre></li>

## Sample customized storage classes
{: #file_custom_storageclass}

You can create a customized storage class and use the storage class in your PVC.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} provides [pre-defined storage classes](#file_storageclass_reference) to provision file storage with a particular tier and configuration. In some cases, you might want to provision storage with a different configuration that is not covered in the pre-defined storage classes. You can use the examples in this topic to find sample customized storage classes.

To create your customized storage class, see [Customizing a storage class](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#customized_storageclass). Then, [use your customized storage class in your PVC](#add_file).

### Creating topology-aware storage
{: #file-topology}

To use file storage in a multizone cluster, your pod must be scheduled in the same zone as your file storage instance so that you can read and write to the volume. Before topology-aware volume scheduling was introduced by Kubernetes, the dynamic provisioning of your storage automatically created the file storage instance when a PVC was created. Then, when you created your pod, the Kubernetes scheduler tried to deploy the pod to a worker node in the same data center as your file storage instance.
{: shortdesc}

Creating the file storage instance without knowing the constraints of the pod can lead to unwanted results. For example, your pod might not be able to be scheduled to the same worker node as your storage because the worker node has insufficient resources or the worker node is tainted and does not allow the pod to be scheduled. With topology-aware volume scheduling, the file storage instance is delayed until the first pod that uses the storage is created.

Topology-aware volume scheduling is supported on clusters that run Kubernetes version 1.12 or later only.
{: note}

The following examples show how to create storage classes that delay the creation of the file storage instance until the first pod that uses this storage is ready to be scheduled. To delay the creation, you must include the `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer` option. If you do not include this option, the `volumeBindingMode` is automatically set to `Immediate` and the file storage instance is created when you create the PVC.

- **Example for Endurance file storage:**
  ```
  apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
  kind: StorageClass
  metadata:
    name: ibmc-file-bronze-delayed
  parameters:
    billingType: hourly
    classVersion: "2"
    iopsPerGB: "2"
    sizeRange: '[20-12000]Gi'
    type: Endurance
  provisioner: ibm.io/ibmc-file
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
  ```
  {: codeblock}

- **Example for Performance file storage:**
  ```
  apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
  kind: StorageClass
  metadata:
   name: ibmc-file-performance-storageclass
   labels:
     kubernetes.io/cluster-service: "true"
  provisioner: ibm.io/ibmc-file
  parameters:
   billingType: "hourly"
   classVersion: "2"
   sizeIOPSRange: |-
     "[20-39]Gi:[100-1000]"
     "[40-79]Gi:[100-2000]"
     "[80-99]Gi:[100-4000]"

### Specifying the zone for multizone clusters
{: #file_multizone_yaml}

If you want to create your file storage in a specific zone, you can specify the zone and region in a customized storage class.
{: shortdesc}

Use the customized storage class if you want to [statically provision file storage](#existing_file) in a specific zone. In all other cases, [specify the zone directly in your PVC](#add_file).
{: note}

When you create the customized storage class, specify the same region and zone that your cluster and worker nodes are in. To get the region of your cluster, run `ibmcloud ks cluster-get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>` and look for the region prefix in the **Master URL**, such as `eu-de` in `https://c2.eu-de.containers.cloud.ibm.com:11111`. To get the zone of your worker node, run `ibmcloud ks workers --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>`.

### Changing the default NFS version
{: #nfs_version_class}

The following customized storage class lets you define the NFS version that you want to provision. For example, to provision NFS version 3.0, replace `<nfs_version>` with **3.0**.
