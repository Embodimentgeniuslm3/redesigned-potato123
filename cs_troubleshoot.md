# Debugging your cluster
{: #cs_troubleshoot}

As you use {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}, consider these techniques for general troubleshooting and debugging your community Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters. You can also check the [status of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} system ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/support/#status).
{: shortdesc}

You can take these general steps to ensure that your clusters are up-to-date:
- Check monthly for available security and operating system patches to [update your worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_update).
- [Update your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_cluster_update) to the latest default version for [community Kubernetes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions) or [OpenShift](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions).<p class="important">Make sure that [your `kubectl` CLI](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#kubectl) client matches the same Kubernetes version as your cluster server. [Kubernetes does not support ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/version-skew-policy/) `kubectl` client versions that are 2 or more versions apart from the server version (n +/- 2).</p>

## Running tests with the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} Diagnostics and Debug Tool
{: #debug_utility}

While you troubleshoot, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} Diagnostics and Debug Tool to run tests and gather pertinent information from your cluster. To use the debug tool, install the [`ibmcloud-iks-debug` Helm chart ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/helm/iks-charts/ibmcloud-iks-debug):
{: shortdesc}


1. [Set up Helm in your cluster, create a service account for Tiller, and add the `ibm` repository to your Helm instance](/docs/containers?topic=containers-helm).

2. Install the Helm chart to your cluster.
  ```
  helm install iks-charts/ibmcloud-iks-debug --name debug-tool
  ```
  {: pre}

3. Start a proxy server to display the debug tool interface.
  ```
  kubectl proxy --port 8080
  ```
  {: pre}

4. In a web browser, open the debug tool interface URL: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/debug-tool-ibmcloud-iks-debug:8822/proxy/page

5. Select individual tests or a group of tests to run. Some tests check for potential warnings, errors, or issues, and some tests only gather information that you can reference while you troubleshoot. For more information about the function of each test, click the information icon next to the test's name.

6. Click **Run**.

7. Check the results of each test.
  * If any test fails, click the information icon next to the test's name in the left column for information about how to resolve the issue.
  * You can also use the results of tests to gather information, such as complete YAMLs, that can help you debug your cluster in the following sections.

## Debugging clusters
{: #debug_clusters}

Review the options to debug your clusters and find the root causes for failures.

1.  List your cluster and find the `State` of the cluster.

  ```
  ibmcloud ks clusters
  ```
  {: pre}

2.  Review the `State` of your cluster. If your cluster is in a **Critical**, **Delete failed**, or **Warning** state, or is stuck in the **Pending** state for a long time, start [debugging the worker nodes](#debug_worker_nodes).

    You can view the current cluster state by running the `ibmcloud ks clusters` command and locating the **State** field.

The [Kubernetes master](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ibm-cloud-kubernetes-service-technology#architecture) is the main component that keeps your cluster up and running. The master stores cluster resources and their configurations in the etcd database that serves as the single point of truth for your cluster. The Kubernetes API server is the main entry point for all cluster management requests from the worker nodes to the master, or when you want to interact with your cluster resources.<br><br>If a master failure occurs, your workloads continue to run on the worker nodes, but you cannot use `kubectl` commands to work with your cluster resources or view the cluster health until the Kubernetes API server in the master is back up. If a pod goes down during the master outage, the pod cannot be rescheduled until the worker node can reach the Kubernetes API server again.<br><br>During a master outage, you can still run `ibmcloud ks` commands against the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} API to work with your infrastructure resources, such as worker nodes or VLANs. If you change the current cluster configuration by adding or removing worker nodes to the cluster, your changes do not happen until the master is back up.

Do not restart or reboot a worker node during a master outage. This action removes the pods from your worker node. Because the Kubernetes API server is unavailable, the pods cannot be rescheduled onto other worker nodes in the cluster.

<tr>
    <td>`Critical`</td>
    <td>A worker node can go into a Critical state for many reasons: <ul><li>You initiated a reboot for your worker node without cordoning and draining your worker node. Rebooting a worker node can cause data corruption in <code>containerd</code>, <code>kubelet</code>, <code>kube-proxy</code>, and <code>calico</code>. </li>
    <li>The pods that are deployed to your worker node do not use resource limits for [memory ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/) and [CPU ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/). Without resource limits, pods can consume all available resources, leaving no resources for other pods to run on this worker node. This overcommitment of workload causes the worker node to fail. </li>
    <li><code>containerd</code>, <code>kubelet</code>, or <code>calico</code> went into an unrecoverable state after it ran hundreds or thousands of containers over time. </li>
    <li>You set up a Virtual Router Appliance for your worker node that went down and cut off the communication between your worker node and the Kubernetes master. </li><li> Current networking issues in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} or IBM Cloud infrastructure that causes the communication between your worker node and the Kubernetes master to fail.</li>
    <li>Your worker node ran out of capacity. Check the <strong>Status</strong> of the worker node to see whether it shows <strong>Out of disk</strong> or <strong>Out of memory</strong>. If your worker node is out of capacity, consider to either reduce the workload on your worker node or add a worker node to your cluster to help load balance the workload.</li>
    <li>The device was powered off from the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console resource list ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources).

    In many cases, [reloading](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reload) your worker node can solve the problem. When you reload your worker node, the latest [patch version](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions#version_types) is applied to your worker node. The major and minor version is not changed. Before you reload your worker node, make sure to cordon and drain your worker node to ensure that the existing pods are terminated gracefully and rescheduled onto remaining worker nodes. </br></br> If reloading the worker node does not resolve the issue, go to the next step to continue troubleshooting your worker node. </br></br><strong>Tip:</strong> You can [configure health checks for your worker node and enable Autorecovery](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health#autorecovery). If Autorecovery detects an unhealthy worker node based on the configured checks, Autorecovery triggers a corrective action like an OS reload on the worker node. For more information about how Autorecovery works, see the [Autorecovery blog ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/12/autorecovery-utilizes-consistent-hashing-high-availability/).

## Reviewing master health
{: #debug_master}

Your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} includes an IBM-managed master with highly available replicas, automatic security patch updates applied for you, and automation in place to recover in case of an incident. You can check the health, status, and state of the cluster master by running `ibmcloud ks cluster-get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>`.
{: shortdesc} 

**Master Health**<br>
The **Master Health** reflects the state of master components and notifies you if something needs your attention. The health might be one of the following:
*   `error`: The master is not operational. IBM is automatically notified and takes action to resolve this issue. You can continue monitoring the health until the master is `normal`.
*   `normal`: The master is operational and healthy. No action is required.
*   `unavailable`: The master might not be accessible, which means some actions such as resizing a worker pool are temporarily unavailable. IBM is automatically notified and takes action to resolve this issue. You can continue monitoring the health until the master is `normal`. 
*   `unsupported`: The master runs an unsupported version of Kubernetes. You must [update your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update) to return the master to `normal` health.

**Master Status and State**<br>
The **Master Status** provides details of what operation from the master state is in progress. The status includes a timestamp of how long the master has been in the same state, such as `Ready (1 month ago)`. The **Master State** reflects the lifecycle of possible operations that can be performed on the master, such as deploying, updating, and deleting. Each state is described in the following table.

<table summary="Every table row should be read left to right, with the master state in column one and a description in column two.">
<caption>Master states</caption>
   <thead>
   <th>Master state</th>
   <th>Description</th>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
<tr>
   <td>`deployed`</td>
   <td>The master is successfully deployed. Check the status to verify that the master is `Ready` or to see if an update is available.</td>
   </tr>
 <tr>
     <td>`deploying`</td>
     <td>The master is currently deploying. Wait for the state to become `deployed` before working with your cluster, such as adding worker nodes.</td>
    </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>`deploy_failed`</td>
     <td>The master failed to deploy. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. Check the **Master Status** field for more information, or wait for the state to become `deployed`.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>`deleting`</td>
   <td>The master is currently deleting because you deleted the cluster. You cannot undo a deletion. After the cluster is deleted, you can no longer check the master state because the cluster is completely removed.</td>
   </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>`delete_failed`</td>
       <td>The master failed to delete. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. You cannot resolve the issue by trying to delete the cluster again. Instead, check the **Master Status** field for more information, or wait for the cluster to delete.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>`updating`</td>
       <td>The master is updating its Kubernetes version. The update might be a patch update that is automatically applied, or a minor or major version that you applied by updating the cluster. During the update, your highly available master can continue processing requests, and your app workloads and worker nodes continue to run. After the master update is complete, you can [update your worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#worker_node).<br><br>
       If the update is unsuccessful, the master returns to a `deployed` state and continues running the previous version. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. You can check if the update failed in the **Master Status** field.</td>

## Debugging app deployments
{: #debug_apps}

Review the options that you have to debug your app deployments and find the root causes for failures.

Before you begin, ensure you have the [**Writer** or **Manager** {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM service role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) for the namespace where your app is deployed.

1. Look for abnormalities in the service or deployment resources by running the `describe` command.

 Example:
 <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl describe service &lt;service_name&gt; </code></pre>

2. [Check whether the containers are stuck in the `ContainerCreating` state](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_storage#stuck_creating_state).

3. Check whether the cluster is in the `Critical` state. If the cluster is in a `Critical` state, check the firewall rules and verify that the master can communicate with the worker nodes.

4. Verify that the service is listening on the correct port.
   1. Get the name of a pod.
     <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl get pods</code></pre>
   2. Log in to a container.
     <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl exec -it &lt;pod_name&gt; -- /bin/bash</code></pre>
   3. Curl the app from within the container. If the port is not accessible, the service might not be listening on the correct port or the app might have issues. Update the configuration file for the service with the correct port and redeploy or investigate potential issues with the app.
     <pre class="pre"><code>curl localhost: &lt;port&gt;</code></pre>

5. Verify that the service is linked correctly to the pods.
   1. Get the name of a pod.
     <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl get pods</code></pre>
   2. Log in to a container.
     <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl exec -it &lt;pod_name&gt; -- /bin/bash</code></pre>
   3. Curl the cluster IP address and port of the service. If the IP address and port are not accessible, look at the endpoints for the service. If no endpoints are listed, then the selector for the service does not match the pods. If endpoints are listed, then look at the target port field on the service and make sure that the target port is the same as what is being used for the pods.
     <pre class="pre"><code>curl &lt;cluster_IP&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code></pre>

6. For Ingress services, verify that the service is accessible from within the cluster.
   1. Get the name of a pod.
     <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl get pods</code></pre>
   2. Log in to a container.
     <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl exec -it &lt;pod_name&gt; -- /bin/bash</code></pre>
   2. Curl the URL specified for the Ingress service. If the URL is not accessible, check for a firewall issue between the cluster and the external endpoint. 
     <pre class="pre"><code>curl &lt;host_name&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;</code></pre>
